# Crime Detection Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a crime detection system using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to analyze patterns in crime data, predict future occurrences, and assist law enforcement agencies in preventing crime.

## Features
- **Crime Data Analysis:** Analyzes crime patterns based on historical data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses machine learning models to predict potential crime hotspots.
- **Visualization:** Provides graphical representations of crime trends and predictions.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** (Optional) Sends alerts when the system predicts a high probability of crime in a certain area.
